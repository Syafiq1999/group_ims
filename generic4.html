							<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Let's dive into the tower at hearts of Muslims beloved building in the world!</b></p>


							<b>The Clock Tower Can Be Spotted From 17 km Away</b>
                              <p><li>The clock on top of Mecca’s highest tower can be seen from 17 kilometres away. Nestled 450 m above the ground, it’s the most elevated architectural clock in the world. No wonder, devotees visiting Mecca can spot it from far away! Additionally, it can also shelter around 2 million pilgrims. </li>
                             </p>

							<b>One Of The World’s Most Expensive Buildings To Be Built</b>
                               <p><li>The cost of constructing the biggest clock tower in the world is a costly affair. Construction began in 2002 and was not completed until 2012. The project’s total cost was $15 billion. Only huge nuclear power plant structures, whose prices are often comparable, may match that sum. </li>
                             </p>

							<b>World’s Largest Clock Face</b>
                               <p><li>Abraj Al-Bait clock tower has the world’s largest clock face. It has a diameter spanning 43 meters. While the hour hand is 17 metres long, the minute hand is 23 metres long. While people often mistake London’s Big Ben to have the largest clock face in the world, Abraj Al-Bait takes the cake for the feat.</li></p>

							<b>The Clock Tower Is Adorned In 24 Carat Gold Leaves</b>
                              <p><li>The Makkah clock tower is covered in 98 million mosaic tiles, including 24-carat gold leaves. The megastructure’s apex is covered with 26 spotlights with a maximum firing range of 10 kilometres. Moreover, the building’s 23-meter crescent is also made of a gold mosaic with a fibreglass backing.</li></p>
